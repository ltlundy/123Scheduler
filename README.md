For this project we have decided to tackle the 123Loadboard of scheduleing wait times.

We devised an application that will allow for shipping companies to schedule deliveries in a way which will minimze wait times.

We developed a greedy algorithm to match drivers to available loading docks according to the shippers specification and the drivers estimated time of arrival.
